## Fairness & Bias Analysis

### Protected Attributes
Model fairness evaluated across:
- **Age:** Ensuring no age-based discrimination
- **Sex/Gender:** Equal performance across gender identities
- **Ethnicity:** (if included) Monitoring for racial/ethnic disparities
- **Socioeconomic Status:** (if proxy features present) Ensuring equity

### Fairness Criteria
Model evaluated against multiple fairness metrics:
1. **Demographic Parity:** Similar positive prediction rates across protected groups (within 10% threshold)
2. **Equal Opportunity:** Similar true positive rates (recall) across groups
3. **Predictive Parity:** Similar precision across groups
4. **Calibration Fairness:** Predicted probabilities well-calibrated within each subgroup

### Bias Mitigation Strategies
- Training data balanced across demographic groups
- Regular bias detection during model training pipeline
- Automated alerts for fairness metric violations
- SMOTE or other resampling techniques for class balance (if applicable)
- Post-processing calibration by subgroup (if needed)

### Current Status
âœ… **Fairness monitoring active** - Automated bias detection runs with each model training iteration

## Limitations & Risks

### Known Limitations
1. **Feature Dependency:** Requires complete metabolic panel; performance degrades with missing laboratory values
2. **Temporal Validity:** Risk factors and clinical guidelines evolve; periodic retraining required
3. **Population Specificity:** Model trained on specific population may not generalize to significantly different demographics
4. **Lifestyle Factors:** Limited ability to capture behavioral risk factors if not systematically documented
5. **Long-term Prediction:** Model predicts near-term risk; long-term predictions require recalibration

### Potential Risks
- **False Negatives:** Missing at-risk patients who don't receive preventive interventions
- **False Positives:** Unnecessary anxiety and testing for low-risk patients
- **Automation Bias:** Over-reliance on predictions without clinical assessment
- **Health Inequity:** Risk of perpetuating existing healthcare disparities if training data is biased
- **Data Quality:** Predictions degrade with incomplete, outdated, or incorrectly measured features
- **Confounding:** Unmeasured confounders (genetics, detailed lifestyle) not captured in model

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Weekly performance tracking, monthly drift detection
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Predictions are advisory; clinical judgment always required
- **Explainability:** SHAP values provided to explain individual predictions
- **Regular Retraining:** Quarterly or annual retraining to maintain accuracy
- **Alert System:** Automated alerts when performance degrades or drift detected
- **Clinical Validation:** Predictions validated against clinical standards of care
